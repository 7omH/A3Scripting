/*
TS code:
addAntenna,if incorrect exits, if not found in list creates, if found in list updates entry
removeAntenna, if incorrect exits, if found in list erase entry

Work around to Game crash/disconnect (where TS stays up) :
a) restart TS 
b) do addAntenna & removeAntenna on JIP = use remoteExec on object (do multiple remote exec exist or only one that gets overwritten)
	active onos will update and those removed will be as well

Work around if TS Crash (game stays up) :
???
	relog into server...
