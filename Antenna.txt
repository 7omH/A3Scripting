/*
TS code:
addAntenna,if incorrect exits, if not found in list creates, if found in list updates entry
removeAntenna, if incorrect exits, if found in list erase entry

Work around to Game crash/disconnect (where TS stays up) :
a) restart TS 
b) do addAntenna & removeAntenna on JIP = use remoteExec on object (do multiple remote exec exist or only one that gets overwritten)
	active onos will update and those removed will be as well

Work around if TS Crash (game stays up) :
???Might not need to, code seems to lead that it refreshes antennas... need to test
	2 check this TFAR_ConfigRefresh https://github.com/michail-nikolaev/task-force-arma-3-radio/blob/6332aaa7a2099d45246981287c4a167ad8696088/addons/antennas/XEH_preInit.sqf#L9
	
	3 create script to handle RAntennas, add a player action that resets current radios 
	GVAR(radioTowerList) = [] call CBA_fnc_hashCreate;
	[GVAR(radioTowerList), _tower, _range] call CBA_fnc_hashSet;
	private _range = [GVAR(radioTowerList),_x] call CBA_fnc_hashGet;
	private _netID = netID _x;
	[_tower1, _tower2] call TFAR_antennas_fnc_pluginAddRadioTower;
